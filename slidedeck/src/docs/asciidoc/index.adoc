== The big problems

[%step]
* Accidental merges. How do we _unmerge_ data?
* Audit Trail
* Versioned resources
* CCDs for Observations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Joshua brought up accidental merges. Unmerging was important for some customer.
We ended up giving a compromise solution.

A lot of people have spent several months just fixing audit trail bugs.

Versioned resources are important to FHIR compliance and for Dory to get incremental
changes.

== Object Relational Mapping

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE PATIENT (
    IDENTIFIER VARCHAR(10),
    AUTHORITY  VARCHAR(20),
    NAME       VARCHAR(20),
    DELETED    NUMBER(1)
)
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Patient {
    String identifier
    String authority
    String name
    Boolean deleted
}
----

=== Making Changes

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE PATIENT SET NAME='RAHUL'
    WHERE IDENTIFIER='32' AND AUTHORITY='1.2.3.4';

INSERT INTO AUDIT_MESSAGE (ID, TYPE, OBJECT_TYPE, OBJECT_ID, DATA)
    VALUES (408, 'UPDATE', 'PATIENT', '32@1.2.3.4', 'NAME CHANGED');

=== How we debug problems

Question: Why is this Patient called **Rahul**?

[%step]
* Look at Patient in UI
* Look at Patient through Grails Console
* Look at Audit Trail
* Look at logs
* Checkout same release as in production
* Find out what the code is doing
* Works as designed

== Versioned Resources


=== Archive Domains

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE PATIENT_ARCHIVE (
    IDENTIFIER VARCHAR(10),
    AUTHORITY  VARCHAR(20),
    VERSION    NUMBER(10),
    NAME       VARCHAR(20),
    DELETED    NUMBER(1)
)

=== Or Event Sourcing

[data-background="images/questionblock.jpg"]
=== &nbsp;

== Audit Trail

=== Developer Discipline

[%step]
* Author of new service code makes an effort to audit trail
* No one bypasses service code that audits something
* Code reviewers catch all these problems
* QA catches all these problems

=== Event Sourcing

== What do banks do?

=== Word Problems III

Mary has **three** apples. She buys **two** apples from the store.

How many apples does she have?

[%step]
Mary has **three** apples.
She buys **two** from the store.
She puts **four** in her Apple Pie.
She receives **six** from her mom.
She gives **two** to John.

How many apples does she have left?

=== Now apply it to Healthcare

_rahul_ created **john** as patient **123@1.2.3.4**

_donald_ changed the name on **123@1.2.3.4** to **mike**

_daffy_ changed the name on **123@1.2.3.4** to **sean**

_goofy_ changed the name on **123@1.2.3.4** to **tim**

_goofy_ realized _that_ was a mistake and reverted that change

What is the name of patient **123@1.2.3.4**?

=== Now apply it to Healthcare II

_micky_ planned an **APPENDECTOMY** for **123@1.2.3.4**

_micky_ planned a **FLUSHOT** for **123@1.2.3.4**

_stevie_ performed a **FLUSHOT** for **123@1.2.3.4**

_micky_ planned a **FLUSHOT** for **123@1.2.3.4**


What are the pending procedures for **123@1.2.3.4**?

What are the procedures performed so far for **123@1.2.3.4**?

=== There can be 1000s of events

image::passbook2.jpg[]

=== Snapshots FTW!

== Event Sourcing Basics

**A**ggregate

**E**vent

**S**napshot

=== Current State

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + sum_(i=1)^N E_i
++++

=== Optimized solution

[stem]
++++
S_K = S_0 + sum_(i=1)^K E_i
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_K + sum_(i=K+1)^N E_i
++++

=== This works, but not always

It assumes that events are applied Left to Right.

[fragment]#Reverts are applied Right to Left#

=== Expanded form

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_(N-1) + E_(N)
++++

=== When Reverts kick in

[stem]
++++
E_N = bar E_k
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_k ... + E_(N-1) + E_N
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_k ... + E_(N-1) + bar E_k
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_k ...  + bar E_k + E_(N-1)
++++

And you can keep shifting the revert to the left until it's right next to E(k)

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_k + bar E_k ... + E_(N-1)
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_0 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3 ... + E_(k-1) + E_(k+1) ... + E_(N-1)
++++

=== In unexpanded form

[stem]
++++
E_N = bar E_k
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_(k-1) + E_k + sum_(i=K+1)^(N-1) E_i + E_N
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_(k-1) + E_k + sum_(i=K+1)^(N-1) E_i + bar E_k
++++

[stem]
++++
S_N = S_(k-1) + sum_(i=K+1)^(N-1) E_i
++++


== Now let's see the code

=== The Aggregate

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientAggregate.groovy[tags=main]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientAggregate.groovy[tags=close]

=== The Snapshot

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientSnapshot.groovy[tags=main]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientSnapshot.groovy[tags=close]
----

=== The Events

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientEvent.groovy[tags=main]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientEvent.groovy[tags=date]

----

=== Example Event

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/domain/esdemo/PatientEvent.groovy[tags=created]
----

== Preserving Sanity

Obviously, you don't want to perform event computation everywhere

=== CQRS

Command Query Responsiblity Segregation

=== Patient Command Util

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientCommandUtil.groovy[tags=begin]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientCommandUtil.groovy[tags=close]
----

=== Patient Query Util

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientQueryUtil.groovy[tags=begin]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientQueryUtil.groovy[tags=method]
        ...
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientQueryUtil.groovy[tags=endMethod]
include::../../../../app/grails-app/utils/esdemo/PatientQueryUtil.groovy[tags=end]

== Demo time

== Problems

[%step]
* Database size for snapshots and events
* Single table vs multi table inheritance
* RDBMS vs Cassandra

== Do not use this in production

There are lots of framework that perform magic that makes it simpler to use ES and CQRS

* Lagom
* Concursus
* ES4j
